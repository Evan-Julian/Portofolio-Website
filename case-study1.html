                EduLearn is a platform designed to help students navigate the
                financial pressures of higher education while also offering
                solutions to academic challenges. Rising education costs, paired
                with increasing living expenses, place significant burdens on
                students. EduLearn utilizes a Design Thinking approach to create
                tools that improve financial management, academic support, and
                overall well-being, helping students achieve success in their
                academic journey.

                1. The Problem: Navigating Student Hardships
              </h3>
              <p>
                Education is a critical foundation shaping one's future.
                However, faced with increasing education costs and financial
                pressure, students feel burdened in pursuing their academic
                dreams. Although higher education costs in Indonesia are
                relatively lower compared to other countries like Australia,
                Singapore, or the United States, this does not reduce the
                financial burden felt by students. According to Databoks,
                Generation Z tends not to allocate savings specifically, with
                56.6% rarely or never saving. The use of credit cards and 'pay
                later' services for non-urgent purchases reaches about 20%,
                adding complexity to financial management. High academic
                workload is also a problem for students, where demanding courses
                and tight deadlines often result in significant mental and
                physical pressure.

              </h3>
              <p>
                Our main goal for EduLearn is to create a solution that provides
                financial assistance and emotional support to students from
                middle to low-income financial backgrounds. This solution must
                ensure easy access to relevant information and resources while
                overcoming the financial obstacles they face. We aim to
                strengthen students' emotional well-being so they can fully
                focus on their academic achievements without being disturbed by
                financial uncertainty or related stress.

                study program at Multimedia Nusantara University, my role
                centered on being a UI/UX Designer and part of the Frontend
                Development Team for EduLearn. My responsibilities covered the
                entire design lifecycle, from user research and ideation to
                prototyping and implementation. I worked closely with

              <h3 class="text-danger">4. Design Process & Solution</h3>
              <p>
                Our design process was rooted in Design Thinking methodologies,
                emphasizing empathy, ideation, prototyping, and testing. This
                iterative approach allowed us to continuously refine our
                solutions based on actual user feedback.
              </p>

              <h4>Empathy Phase: Understanding Users</h4>
              <p>
                In the Empathy phase, the main focus is on deeply understanding
                the experiences, needs, and motivations of users. We used a
                combined approach of online interviews with students, parents,
                and employees, as well as direct observation of student
                activities. Interview results showed that students face
                financial pressure affecting their emotional and academic
                well-being, and parents are proud if their children have strong
                personalities, are responsible, and achieve academic success.
              </p>
              <div class="image-placeholder">
                <img

                <p class="image-caption">Figure 3: Example Empathy Map.</p>
              </div>
              <p>
                Based on these findings, we developed personas for students
                (from middle to low-income backgrounds), parents of students,
                and employees who have attended college, to deeply understand
                user needs and concerns.
              </p>

              <h4>Define Phase: Formulating the Problem</h4>
              <p>
                In the Define phase, we analyzed the collected data to clearly
                and specifically identify the problems that needed to be solved.
                The main problem statement found was that students from middle
                to low-income financial backgrounds face significant financial
                challenges, creating stress and anxiety, which can reduce their
                focus and academic performance.
              </p>
              <ul class="styled-list">
                <li>
                  <i class="bx bx-question-mark"></i> Main Problem: Students
                  experience financial difficulties, feel sad, confused, and
                  even consider dropping out of college.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i class="bx bx-question-mark"></i> Need: Students want to
                  take action to solve financial problems while maintaining

              </ul>
              <p>
                From here, we formulated "How Might We" questions to guide
                ideation, focusing on helping students fulfill their parents'
                hopes, providing definite financial support, providing reliable
                job vacancy information, and maintaining their academic focus.
              </p>

              <h4>Ideate Phase: Generating Innovative Solutions</h4>
              <p>
                The Ideate phase allows team collaboration to generate as many
                ideas as possible to solve the defined problems. We used
                techniques such as Brainstorming and SCAMPER Techniques to
                foster creativity and innovation.
              </p>

              <h5>Brainstorming:</h5>
              <p>
                Brainstorming sessions generated diverse ideas to help students
                make their parents proud (e.g., scholarship information,
                self-development, part-time jobs), provide reliable job vacancy
                information (e.g., company collaborations, career days,
                information guarantees), and support student finances without
                sacrificing academics (e.g., flexible schedules, investment
                education, academic competitions).
              </p>

              <h5>SCAMPER Techniques:</h5>
              <p>Through SCAMPER, we modified existing ideas:</p>

                Although this project focuses on the design and ideation phases
                (based on the college proposal), the EduLearn concept is
                designed to have a significant impact. By providing valid
                information on scholarships and job opportunities, EduLearn aims
                to increase students' financial accessibility. Furthermore,
                through educational content and self-development features, this
                platform contributes to improving the skills of students and
                workers. The implementation of AI for data validation and job
                recommendations also increases the efficiency and accuracy of
                information. The freemium business model ensures the platform's
                sustainability while remaining accessible to all users.
