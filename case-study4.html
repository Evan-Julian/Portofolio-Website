                a deep understanding of consumer behavior and product
                preferences to enhance company competitiveness, while
                recommendations focus on optimizing e-commerce strategies,
                expanding sales channels, and product innovation. By taking
                these steps, companies can achieve greater success in sales in
                G20 countries in the European Region.

                1. The Problem: Uncovering Insights from Complex Global Consumer
                Data
              </h3>
              <p>
                With consumer behavior constantly evolving, especially in
                emerging markets, it became increasingly important for
                businesses to understand trends and preferences at a global
                scale. The challenge was to process vast amounts of data from
                various, often disparate, sources and to transform this raw data
                into meaningful, actionable insights. Without effective
                visualization and analysis, businesses struggle to identify key
                patterns, regional preferences, and spending habits that are
                crucial for strategic decision-making and product development.

                Our primary goal was to create interactive Tableau dashboards
                that provide easy and intuitive access to complex consumer
                behavior data. We aimed to deliver clear visualizations of
                regional preferences, spending patterns, and purchasing
                behaviors, enabling businesses to filter data by country, income
                level, and product category. The ultimate objective was to
                empower businesses with the insights necessary to make
                well-informed strategic decisions in a competitive global
                market, improving product offerings and market penetration.

              <h3 class="text-danger">4. Design Process & Solution</h3>
              <p>
                Our research methodology involved a systematic approach to data
                collection, preprocessing, and in-depth analysis to extract
                meaningful insights from the Europe Sales Record dataset. The
                entire analytical process was meticulously designed to provide a
                detailed understanding of market dynamics in the region.
              </p>

              <h4>Data Collection & Preprocessing</h4>
              <p>
                The dataset used in this research originates from company sales
                records operating in the European Region, covering the period
                from January 1, 2010, to July 23, 2017. The data collected
                includes information on various aspects of sales transactions,
                such as the country of origin, item type, sales channel (online
                or offline), order priority, order and ship dates, units sold,
                and unit price. Data preprocessing involved identifying and
                removing errors, duplicates, and missing values. Raw data was
                transformed into a suitable format for analysis (e.g., date
                conversion to DateTime, numerical values to proper formats).
                Data grouping was performed based on relevant categories like
                country, product type, sales channel, and time period,
                facilitating comparative analysis and trend identification.
              </p>

              <h4>Data Visualization & Dashboard Creation with Tableau</h4>
              <p>
                Descriptive analysis was performed to provide an overview of the
                data, including frequency distribution, mean, median, and
                variance. Data was visualized using charts and diagrams
                (histograms, pie charts, line graphs) to clearly display
                analysis results. Tableau dashboards were specifically utilized
                to provide a comprehensive overview of company profit, sales
                performance, unit costs, and units sold over the past year in
                G20 European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and the
                UK).

              <p>
                The analysis of the sales data through various dashboards
                yielded several important findings. The Data Profit analysis
                provided a comprehensive view of company profit performance in
                G20 European countries, offering insights into seasonal sales
                patterns, best-selling products, and effective sales channel
                distribution, which is valuable for adaptive business
                strategies. The Sales Data analysis highlighted future sales
                forecasts and detailed breakdowns by item type and country,
                enabling identification of successful products and evaluation of
                marketing effectiveness. The Unit Cost analysis provided a clear
                understanding of factors influencing production or service
                costs, helping identify and manage cost savings opportunities.
                Lastly, the Unit Sold analysis provided deep insights into sales
                performance, identifying popular products, sales trends, and

                Based on the data analysis, companies can enhance their sales
                performance and profitability in the European market by
                optimizing marketing strategies based on findings about popular
                products and sales trends, paying attention to sales comparisons
                between countries to expand market share, and evaluating costs
                to identify savings opportunities. It is crucial to continuously
                monitor performance to quickly respond to market changes and
                make necessary strategic adjustments. With a better
                understanding of consumer purchasing patterns and product
                preferences, this research is expected to significantly
                contribute to global consumer behavior literature and help
                companies achieve greater success in a competitive market.
