                Nike is one of the largest and most recognized athletic shoe
                brands globally, renowned for its high-quality products and
                innovative designs. To understand consumer acceptance of Nike
                shoes, sales data from various online platforms (Nike official
                website, Amazon, and other retailers) was collected. This data
                includes product information, pricing, discounts, ratings,
                reviews, and images. The analysis was conducted using the
                CRISP-DM method and SAS data analysis tools to identify consumer
                trends and preference patterns. The results of this analysis are
                expected to provide useful insights for designing more effective
                product and marketing strategies, enhancing customer
                satisfaction, and optimizing Nike's sales.

                1. The Problem: Deciphering Complex Consumer Behavior for
                Strategic Advantage
              </h3>
              <p>
                Understanding how Nike shoes are received by consumers is
                crucial for strategic decision-making. The challenge lies in
                extracting meaningful insights from a diverse dataset that
                includes product information, pricing, discounts, ratings,
                reviews, and images from various online platforms. Traditional
                analysis methods may not fully uncover the complex patterns and
                predictive behaviors needed for effective marketing and product
                development. In the era of data-driven decision-making, machine
                learning becomes an invaluable tool to discover intricate
                patterns and predict consumer behavior, especially in complex
                sales contexts. The goal is to identify the best algorithms to
                recognize patterns that reflect consumer behavior through
                historical data analysis.

              <h3 class="text-danger">Conclusion & Future Outlook</h3>
              <p>
                The use of various predictive models in Nike shoe sales analysis
                provides deep insights into consumer trends and product rating
                predictions. While Neural Network and Linear Regression emerged
                as the best models, the strengths of each model can be utilized
                to support better business decisions. For future development,
                key recommendations include enhancing data quality through
                better cleaning and additional collection, exploring advanced
                machine learning techniques like Deep Learning for higher data
                complexity, and integrating these models into existing
                management systems for real-time operational decision-making.
                Furthermore, investing in internal staff training for effective
                model operation and continuously monitoring model performance
                are crucial to ensure reliability and responsiveness to market
                changes. By applying these recommendations, the predictive
                models in Nike shoe sales analysis can become even more
                effective and generate a more positive impact for the company.
